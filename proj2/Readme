Assignment: Programming project 2

This project uses the following:
  - python 2.7
  - Apache thrift


 Things to be noted:
 - my code uses trace statements (aka print statements that can be turned off by a flag)
    These should be disabled by default. (TRACE = False)
 - the generated thrift code needs to be in the same directory as the "server" file to work as intended
